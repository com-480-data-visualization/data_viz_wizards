## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

In this project, we analyze global music trends using the Spotify HUGE database from Kaggle (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pepepython/spotify-huge-database-daily-charts-over-3-years). This dataset contains all the songs in Spotify’s Daily Top 200 charts in 35+1 (global) countries around the world in the years from 2017-2020 . We focus on the Final Database.csv file, which contains 151 attributes and 170,633 rows, refining it through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The dataset has 151 columns, which is too much for a meaningful analysis and visualization. Additionally we have to ensure that all columns have the expected datatype and that not too many values are missing, especially in the most important columns. Therefore we perform the following steps:

• Dropping columns: Identifying and removing columns that are not relevant for the analysis and visualization, especially the one-hot encoding of categorial variables

• Date conversion: Converting the release date attribute to datetime

• Check for missing values: Checking for columns with missing values and the percentage of missing values in these columns. Fortunately, in each column there are not more than 50% missing values and the most important columns don’t have any missing values

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.

## Milestone 2 (18th April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**


## Milestone 3 (30th May, 5pm)

**80% of the final grade**


## Late policy

- < 24h: 80% of the grade for the milestone
- < 48h: 70% of the grade for the milestone
